    <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">What is a Website Design Creative Brief?</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">A website design creative brief is a document that contains all the necessary information to create and build a new website from scratch. But careful, the brief doesn’t just include the visual direction of the project, it also contains logistics information like budget, deliverables, dates, responsibilities, milestones, and so on.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Even though creating one for your projects might sound like a waste of time, it’s not. A brief is an essential component of every creative project since it puts everyone on the same page, from the client to the designers, the copywriter, and the manager.

        ‍</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Not building one also increases the risk of miscommunication between agency/freelancer and client. This can derive from having to redesign the website since “it’s not what the client asked for”, or even worse, an unhappy client that will never come back and do business with you.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            
            Now that you know the importance of building a good creative brief for your website designs - no matter if they are a whole marketing site or a simple landing page - let’s dive deep into what makes a perfect web design brief.

        <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">What Makes a Perfect Web Design Brief Document
        </h1>
        <p>After years of experience as designers and working with dozens of agencies, we’ve realized that every effective creative brief shares the following 3 characteristics:

            ‍</p>
            <ul style="font-size: 30px;">
                <li><strong>They are comprehensive, yet simple:</strong>
                <p>
                    Yes, this feature sounds paradoxical, but it’s not. A good website design brief covers all the necessary elements for the successful completion of the project but nothing more. It isn’t complicated and doesn’t confuse the client when filling it out. In other words, each question and exercise serves a specific purpose.
                </p>
            </li>
                <li><strong>They provide a creative direction‍</strong>
                    <p>Without some guidelines, the designer will feel lost and won’t know how to handle the project. That’s why good briefs give the creative a sense of what the client is looking for. We will explore this section later.

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>They put everyone on the same page</strong>
                    <p>This is perhaps the most important characteristic of effective briefs. The goal of this document is to inform everyone involved in the project who is responsible, what are the deliverables, which steps will be taken to reach the final result, and so on.</p>
                    <p>
                        When building your next website brief, be sure that they possess these features. If you do so, you are on the right path to building the perfect briefing document. Now, let’s explore…</p>
